This is a super simple blog built with Laravel.
There's a bunch of comments in here, and a bunch more in Evernote.
Folders to look at:
- Routes
- App - Http/controllers, and the models.
- Resources - views and assets (didn't do anything in assets, but it's where all of our preprocessed stuff will go.)
- Public - where the processed assets will go.
- Database/migrations - Shows how columns get added to DB.
- Config - didn't do much in here, besides logging emails to the log file in...
- storage/logs


## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).
